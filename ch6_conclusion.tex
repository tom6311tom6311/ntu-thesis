\label{c:conclusion}

In this work, we propose FileFarm, a P2P overlay that leverages existing cloud services to form a secured cloud-of-clouds storage system with no single-point-of-failure. Beyond the desired properties inherited from Kademlia DHT such as load-balancing, efficient search and redundancy maintenance, FileFarm is provided with additional designs in order to meet requirements in various aspects: data confidentiality, access management, cost efficiency and retrievability. As a whole, FileFarm integrates these characteristics into a robust enterprise cloud storage system in terms of cloud-of-clouds or even a hybrid setting where enterprises' private servers cooperate with public clouds to offer services with lower delay and higher throughput. The benefits and overhead of our designs are explored by both analytical approaches and experiments. We also implement a prototype of FileFarm and evaluate performance or our novel P2P cloud storage solution based on it.
